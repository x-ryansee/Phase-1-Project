# BAR cart TENDER

As a user, I want to be able to:
1. add cocktail recipes to the server
2. Enter inventory of my bar cart, and have the app return all different cocktails/drinks I can possibly make.


I had to hard code a lot of what i've done so far because I can't figure out how to reference JSON or get it to show up.

New cocktail isn't posting.  I think it's because i have .value, but it should already be selected?

Line 16-17, can I add event listener to toggle a bold when clicked?
Add CSS to renderDetails, show up on the right side of the screen
Change checkboxes to be in 5 columns
Have checkboxes add new cocktail to the screen
Type in your ingredients and have it return what you're able to make
Have the cocktails save to the JSON

name='ingredients[]'
value='whatever ingredient nameâ€™
event.target.ingredients.value
css.grid.io
